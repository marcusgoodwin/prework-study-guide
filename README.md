# <My Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A Guide that I can continue to add notes to, change, and experiment with.


- My motivation for building this is that I love to learn how to do new things, and I love the challenge of coding in styles that are new to me.
- I built this project because it was a good way for me to refamiliarize myself with the curriculium well before class starts.
- A problem I solved while doing creating this was that I had never used git, or anything relating to it, and it was a challenge to remember to do all of the steps before moving on.
- I learned how to push and pull code from other branches and Github.

## Usage

The webpage is split up into 4 sections, each of which have notes or tips to help me study these topics, and add specifically to them as the course goes on. If you open up the DevTools on chrome, and navigate to the console tab, the page will actually randomly assign you a topic to study.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
